### Security Considerations

- Regular database backups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**: Check your Gmail credentials and app password
2. **Database errors**: Ensure the database file has proper permissions
3. **CORS errors**: Make sure the backend is running on port 5000
4. **Frontend not loading**: Check that the backend API is accessible
